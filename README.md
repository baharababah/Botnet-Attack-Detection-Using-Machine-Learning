#In this project, we are going to work on a houses priced dataset that has the follwing columns:
-price 	
-bedrooms 	
-bathrooms 	
sqft_living 	
sqft_lot 	
floors
waterfront
view 
condition
grade 
sqft_above 
sqft_basement 
yr_built 
yr_renovated 
zipcode
lat 
long 
sqft_living15 
sqft_lot15


#The two main objectives of the project are:
##present the essentail data analysys and processing methods in order to build a Linear Regression Model.
##build a Linear Regression model that is able to predict the price of the house based on other certain variables. 


#We are going to use Linear Regression for this dataset in order to highlight the essential analysis .



#Note: ALL the steps of analysing the data and building  the model are explained in the comments with the code
