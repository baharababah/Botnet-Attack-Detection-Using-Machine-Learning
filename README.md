# In this project, we are going to work on a houses priced dataset that has the follwing columns:
- price 	
- bedrooms 	
- bathrooms 	
- sqft_living 	
- sqft_lot 	
- floors
- waterfront
- view 
- condition
- grade 
- sqft_above 
- sqft_basement 
- yr_built 
- yr_renovated 
- zipcode
- lat 
- long 
- sqft_living15 
- sqft_lot15


# The two main objectives of the project are:
- Present the essentail data analysys and processing steps in order to build a Linear Regression Model.
- Build a Linear Regression model that is able to predict the price of the house based on other certain variables. 



# Note: ALL the steps of analysing and processing the data and building  the model are explained in the Python Notebook.
